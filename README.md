age-of-time-map
===============
Generates a map for the game Age of Time (http://www.ageoftime.com/). I gathered the data a long time ago with the intent of creating this map - I don't remember the command to get the terrain elevation given (x, y) coordinates.

##Running Locally
The script in index.html will not be able to run if it is opened using the 'file:' protocol. As a workaround, start a HTTP server using 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
and access it through http://localhost:8000/index.html
